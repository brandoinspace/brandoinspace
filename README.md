I am a student working to become an aerospace engineer with a focus on astronautics who loves to program for fun!

I have a lot of experience with programming and have dabbled in my different languages and applications for the fun of it. I started to learn to program in 2020 with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript and have had a lot of fun so far.

Most of my public repositories are in my personal [github repository](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken). It is what contains my more beginner projects and most of my public FOSS contributions. It started out with website development [(1)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/old.breadcrumb.fun) silly projects [(2)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/SpamThingPython) [(3)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/RootbeerSSG) [(4)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/RootbeerSSG-Plugins) and minor convenience programs for applications like Blender [(5)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/MCSkinerBoi), to dealing with more fun stuff like Mincraft server [(6)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/BreadVibesMC)/plugin developement [(7)](https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen) to game development with Godot [(8)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/GDYarn) [(9)](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager) and random projects in Rust [(10)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/mcgen) [(11)](https://github.com/brandoinspace/quick_trim) and C# [(12)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/TicTacToe).

I have also done some super cool things like add language syntax highlighting to GitHub [(13)](https://github.com/DenizenScript/denizenscript-grammar) and created a surprisingly popular icon theme for Visual Studio Code [(14)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/wobbly-icon-theme)

I have contributed to many different open source projects such as Denizen [(7)](https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen) [(15)](https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen-Core) [(16)](https://github.com/DenizenScript/dDiscordBot) [(17)](https://github.com/DenizenScript/Clientizen) [(18)](https://github.com/DenizenScript/Depenizen), Citizens2 [(19)](https://github.com/CitizensDev/Citizens), cloc [(20)](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc), Linguist [(21)](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist), and Godot Dialgoue Manager [(9)](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager).

I have a passion for website development and I love working with HTML and CSS. Rust and Python are some of my strongest languages, but I rarely use Python now. Java is slowly creeping up to the experience level!

I have varying experience in the following (in order of experience level):
- (experienced!) Python, Rust, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, C#, Visual Studio Code
- (moderate) MongoDB, Shell, Visual Studio
- (very little) C++, PHP

Some of my favorite projects include: [(7)](https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen), [(13)](https://github.com/DenizenScript/denizenscript-grammar), [(11)](https://github.com/brandoinspace/quick_trim), and [(3)](https://github.com/BreadcrumbIsTaken/RootbeerSSG)!

Thank you have a great day!
